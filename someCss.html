<h1><font color="blue"> <font size="8"> Noelle Huck</h1> </FONT> </FONT>
   <p><font size="4"> My name is Noelle and I grew up in Yakima, Washington. I played soccer my entire life, but my dream was to attent the University of Washington after high school. I am now a sophomore at UW and plan on majoring in molecular biology.</font></p>
  <font size="3"><FONT FACE="desdemona">One of the cool places I've learned about in Seattle is the Conservatory at Volunteer Park. You can walk through a greenhouse of amazing plants and then walk outside to the beautiful park. Another place I went to this summer was Madison Park Beach. Lots of families go to swim, hangout, and jump off the diving boards on the dock in the middle of the lake. Seattle also has beautiful parks, like Ravenna Park, which makes you feel almost like you're in a forest.' </FONT>
